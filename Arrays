Operations on Array :

1. array(data type, value list) :- This function is used to create an array with data type and value list specified in its arguments. 

2. append() :- This function is used to add the value mentioned in its arguments at the end of the array.

3. insert(i,x) :- This function is used to add the value at the position specified in its argument.

# Python code to demonstrate the working of  
# array(), append(), insert() 
   
# importing "array" for array operations 
import array 
   
# initializing array with array values 
# initializes array with signed integers 
arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])  
  
# printing original array 
print ("The new created array is : ",end=" ") 
for i in range (0, 3): 
    print (arr[i], end=" ") 
  
print("\r") 
  
# using append() to insert new value at end 
arr.append(4); 
  
# printing appended array 
print("The appended array is : ", end="") 
for i in range (0, 4): 
    print (arr[i], end=" ") 
      
# using insert() to insert value at specific position 
# inserts 5 at 2nd position 
arr.insert(2, 5) 
  
print("\r") 
  
# printing array after insertion 
print ("The array after insertion is : ", end="") 
for i in range (0, 5): 
    print (arr[i], end=" ") 
    
Output:

The new created array is : 1 2 3 
The appended array is : 1 2 3 4 
The array after insertion is : 1 2 5 3 4 

4. pop() :- This function removes the element at the position mentioned in its argument, and returns it.

5. remove() :- This function is used to remove the first occurrence of the value mentioned in its arguments.

# Python code to demonstrate the working of  
# pop() and remove() 
   
# importing "array" for array operations 
import array 
   
# initializing array with array values 
# initializes array with signed integers 
arr= array.array('i',[1, 2, 3, 1, 5])  
  
# printing original array 
print ("The new created array is : ",end="") 
for i in range (0,5): 
    print (arr[i],end=" ") 
  
print ("\r") 
  
# using pop() to remove element at 2nd position 
print ("The popped element is : ",end="") 
print (arr.pop(2)); 
  
# printing array after popping 
print ("The array after popping is : ",end="") 
for i in range (0,4): 
    print (arr[i],end=" ") 
  
print("\r") 
  
# using remove() to remove 1st occurrence of 1 
arr.remove(1) 
  
# printing array after removing 
print ("The array after removing is : ",end="") 
for i in range (0,3): 
    print (arr[i],end=" ") 
Output:

The new created array is : 1 2 3 1 5 
The popped element is : 3
The array after popping is : 1 2 1 5 
The array after removing is : 2 1 5 
 

6. index() :- This function returns the index of the first occurrence of value mentioned in arguments.

7. reverse() :- This function reverses the array.


# Python code to demonstrate the working of  
# index() and reverse() 
   
# importing "array" for array operations 
import array 
   
# initializing array with array values 
# initializes array with signed integers 
arr= array.array('i',[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5])  
  
# printing original array 
print ("The new created array is : ",end="") 
for i in range (0,6): 
    print (arr[i],end=" ") 
  
print ("\r") 
  
# using index() to print index of 1st occurrenece of 2 
print ("The index of 1st occurrence of 2 is : ",end="") 
print (arr.index(2)) 
  
#using reverse() to reverse the array 
arr.reverse() 
  
# printing array after reversing 
print ("The array after reversing is : ",end="") 
for i in range (0,6): 
    print (arr[i],end=" ") 
Output:

The new created array is : 1 2 3 1 2 5 
The index of 1st occurrence of 2 is : 1
The array after reversing is : 5 2 1 3 2 1

8. Enumerate :- enumerate(list, start='0')  prints index along with values in list
example: for i,n in enumerate(nums,0):
print(i,n)
